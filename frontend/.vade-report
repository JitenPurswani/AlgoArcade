Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js App Router

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the AlgoArcade Next.js frontend application. This enables tracking of user interactions and performance metrics through Vercel's analytics platform.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package using npm
- Updated `frontend/package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `frontend/package-lock.json` with the dependency tree

### 2. Integration with App Router
**Modified File: `frontend/app/layout.tsx`**
- Uncommented the import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
- Uncommented the `<Analytics />` component in the root layout's body tag
- Placed the component after `{children}` as recommended for App Router projects

## Technical Details
- **Project Type**: Next.js App Router (uses app/ directory)
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Analytics Component Location**: Root layout file (`frontend/app/layout.tsx`)
- **Component Placement**: Inside the `<body>` tag, after children rendering

## Verification
✓ Build completed successfully with no errors
✓ TypeScript compilation passed
✓ Linter ran (no new errors introduced related to Analytics)
✓ All pages generated correctly:
  - Static routes: / (home), /games (games list), and individual game pages
  - Dynamic routes: /games/[game] for individual game pages

## Why This Approach
1. **App Router Configuration**: The project uses Next.js 16.1.0 with the modern App Router pattern
2. **Root Layout Placement**: Adding Analytics in the root layout ensures it runs on all pages automatically
3. **No Breaking Changes**: The component is placed after children rendering, preserving existing page structure
4. **Minimal Impact**: Only required adding the import and component, no refactoring needed

## Next Steps
The Analytics component is now active and will automatically track user sessions, events, and core web vitals when the application is deployed to Vercel. Users can view these metrics in their Vercel dashboard.
